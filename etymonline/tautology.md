## tautology (n.)

"repetition of the same word, or use of several words conveying the same idea, in the same immediate context; repetition of the same thing in different words; the useless repetition of the same idea or meaning" (as in _they arrived simultaneously at the same time_); 1570s, from Late Latin _tautologia_ "representation of the same thing in other words," from Greek _tautologia_, from _tautologos_ "repeating what has been said." This is a compound of _tauto_ "the same" (see [tauto-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/tauto- "Etymology, meaning and definition of tauto- ")) + _\-logos_ "saying" (see [Logos](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Logos "Etymology, meaning and definition of Logos "))." Related: _Tautological; tautologically; tautologous; tautologize_.

> _Tautology_ is repetition without addition of force or clearness, and is disguised by a change of wording ; it differs from the _repetition_ which is used for clearness, emphasis, or effect, and which may be either in the same or in different words \[Century Dictionary\]

“同一词语的重复，或在同一上下文中使用几个词语传达相同的思想；用不同的词重复同一事物；毫无意义地重复同一思想或意义”（如 _they arrived simultaneously at the same time_）；源于1570年代，来自晚期拉丁语 _tautologia_ “用其他词表示同一事物”，进一步来源于希腊语 _tautologia_，来自 _tautologos_ “重复已说过的话”。这是由 _tauto_ “相同的”（参见 [tauto-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/tauto- "Etymology, meaning and definition of tauto- ")）+ _\-logos_ “说”（参见 [Logos](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Logos "Etymology, meaning and definition of Logos ")）组成的复合词。相关词： _Tautological_（冗言的）；_tautologically_（以冗言的方式）；_tautologous_（冗言的）；_tautologize_（进行冗言的）。

> _Tautology_ 是一种没有额外力量或清晰度的重复，并通过词语的改变来掩饰；它与用于清晰、强调或效果的 _repetition_ 不同，后者可以使用相同或不同的词语 \[世纪词典\]。
