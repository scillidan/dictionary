## oxymoron (n.)

in rhetoric, "a figure conjoining words or terms apparently contradictory so as to give point to the statement or expression," 1650s, from Greek _oxymōron_, noun use of neuter of _oxymōros_ (adj.) "pointedly foolish," from _oxys_ "sharp, pointed" (from PIE root [\*ak-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*ak- "Etymology, meaning and definition of *ak- ") "be sharp, rise (out) to a point, pierce") + _mōros_ "stupid" (see [moron](https://www.etymonline.com/word/moron "Etymology, meaning and definition of moron ")). The word itself is an illustration of the thing. Now often used loosely to mean "contradiction in terms." Related: _Oxymoronic_.

在修辞学中，“一种将看似矛盾的词或术语结合在一起的修辞手法，以加强陈述或表达的效果”，出现在1650年代，来源于希腊语 _oxymōron_，是中性名词形式，源于形容词 _oxymōros_ “尖锐愚蠢的”，由 _oxys_ “尖锐、尖端”（源自PIE词根 [\*ak-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*ak- "Etymology, meaning and definition of *ak- ") “尖锐，突出到一个点，穿透”）和 _mōros_ “愚蠢的”（参见 [moron](https://www.etymonline.com/word/moron "Etymology, meaning and definition of moron ")）构成。这个词本身就是这种修辞手法的一个例子。现在常被宽泛地用来表示“术语间的矛盾”。相关词：_Oxymoronic_（矛盾修辞的）。
