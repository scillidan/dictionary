## consume (v.)

late 14c., "to destroy by separating into parts which cannot be reunited, as by burning or eating," hence "destroy the substance of, annihilate," from Old French _consumer_ "to consume" (12c.) and directly from Latin _consumere_ "to use up, eat, waste," from assimilated form of _com-_, here perhaps an intensive prefix (see [com-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/com- "Etymology, meaning and definition of com- ")), + _sumere_ "to take," from _sub-_ "under" (see [sub-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/sub- "Etymology, meaning and definition of sub- ")) + _emere_ "to buy, take" (from PIE root [\*em-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*em- "Etymology, meaning and definition of *em- ") "to take, distribute").

Specifically, "to destroy by use, wear out by applying to its natural or intended use" from c. 1400. Sense of "to engage the full attention and energy of" is from 1570s.

"消费" (consume) 在14世纪晚期意指“通过分离成无法重聚的部分来摧毁，如同通过燃烧或吞噬”，因此引申为“摧毁物质，消灭”。该词源于中古法语 _consumer_ (12世纪) 和直接源自拉丁语 _consumere_，意思是“用尽，吃，浪费”。其中的构成是前缀 _com-_，这里可能是一个加强前缀 (参考 [com-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/com- "Etymology, meaning and definition of com- ")) + _sumere_，意为“取”，来自 _sub-_ (参考 [sub-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/sub- "Etymology, meaning and definition of sub- "))，意为“在...之下” + _emere_，意为“购买，获取”，其源于原始印欧语根 [\*em-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*em- "Etymology, meaning and definition of *em- ")，表示“获取，分发”。

具体来说，"通过使用摧毁，或因其自然或预期用途的应用而磨损" 的含义出现在约1400年。关于"全心全意投入精力"的意思则出现在1570年代。
