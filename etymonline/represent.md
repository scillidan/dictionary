## represent (v.)

late 14c., _representen_, "show, display, express; bring to mind by description," also "to symbolize, serve as a sign or symbol of (something else, something abstract); serve as the type or embodiment of;" also be a representative of" (the authority of another).

This is from Old French _representer_ "present, show, portray" (12c.) and directly from Latin _repraesentare_ "make present, set in view, show, exhibit, display," from _re-_, here perhaps an intensive prefix (see [re-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/re- "Etymology, meaning and definition of re- ")), + _praesentare_ "to present," literally "to place before." Latin _praesentare_ is from _praesens,_ "present, at hand, in sight; immediate; prompt, instant; contemporary," itself from the present participle of the verb _præesse_ "be before (someone or something), be at hand," from _prae-_ "before" (see [pre-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/pre- "Etymology, meaning and definition of pre- ")) + _esse_ "to be" (from PIE root [\*es-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*es- "Etymology, meaning and definition of *es- ") "to be").

Specifically in legal actions, "speak and act with authority on behalf of another by deputed right," by 1500. Also from c. 1500 as "describe as having a specified character or quality." The legislative sense "be accredited deputy for (a body of people) in a legislative assembly" is attested from 1650s.

The meaning "serve as a specimen or example of" is by 1858, at first usually passive (_the Dead Rabbits were represented by_, etc.). Related: _Represented_; _representing_.

14世纪末，_representen_，“展示，显示，表达；通过描述使人想起”，同时也指“象征，作为（某物或某个抽象概念的）标志或象征；作为某人的代表”（他人的权威）。

该词源于古法语 _representer_ “呈现，展示，描绘”（12世纪）并直接源于拉丁语 _repraesentare_ “使呈现，显现，展示，展出”，由 _re-_ 组成，这里可能是强化前缀（参见 [re-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/re- "Etymology, meaning and definition of re- ")），+ _praesentare_ “呈现”，字面意思是“放在前面”。拉丁语 _praesentare_ 源自 _praesens_，“在场，手边，看得见；立即，及时；当代”，本身来源于动词 _præesse_ 的现在分词“在（某人或某物）之前，下降于手边”，由 _prae-_ “在……之前”（参见 [pre-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/pre- "Etymology, meaning and definition of pre- ")）+ _esse_ “存在”（源自PIE词根 [\*es-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*es- "Etymology, meaning and definition of *es- ") “存在”）。

在法律行为中特别指“以授权的权利代表他人发言和行动”，至1500年已见于文献。此外，自约1500年起，表示“描述为具有特定特征或品质”。法律上的“在立法集会上为（一群人）担任被认可的代理人”的含义自1650年代起被记录。

“作为样本或例证”的用法则起始于1858年，最初通常为被动形式（如 _the Dead Rabbits were represented by_ 等）。相关词：_Represented_；_representing_。
