## multi-

before vowels _mult-_, word-forming element meaning "many, many times, much," from combining form of Latin _multus_ "much, many," from PIE _\*ml-to-_, from root [\*mel-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*mel- "Etymology, meaning and definition of *mel-  ") (2) "strong, great, numerous." It was much-used in forming Latin compounds in classical times and after (such as _multianimis_ "having much courage," _multibibus_ "much-drinking," _multicomus_ "having much hair," _multiloquus_ "talkative"). Many English words that use it ([multinational](https://www.etymonline.com/word/multinational "Etymology, meaning and definition of multinational "), etc.) are 20c. coinages.
