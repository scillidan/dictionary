## receipt (n.)

late 14c., _receit_, "act of receiving;" also "statement of ingredients in and formula for making a potion or medicine" (compare [_recipe_](https://www.etymonline.com/word/recipe "Etymology, meaning and definition of recipe ")); from Anglo-French or Old North French _receite_ "receipt, _recipe_, prescription" (c. 1300), altered (by influence of _receit_ "he receives," from Vulgar Latin _\*recipit_) from Old French _recete._ This is from Medieval Latin Latin _recepta_ "thing or money received," in classical Latin "received," fem. past participle of _recipere_ "to hold, contain" (see [receive](https://www.etymonline.com/word/receive "Etymology, meaning and definition of receive ")).

The classical _\-p-_ began to be restored in the English word after c. 1500, but the pronunciation did not follow. _Conceit_, _deceit_, and _receipt_ all are from Latin _capere_; the _\-p-_ sometimes was restored in all three of them, but it has stuck only in the last. The meaning "written acknowledgment for having received something specified" is from c. 1600.

14世纪晚期，_receit_，表示“接收的行为” (act of receiving)；同时也指“药水或药物的成分说明与配方” (statement of ingredients in and formula for making a potion or medicine) (比较 [_recipe_](https://www.etymonline.com/word/recipe "Etymology, meaning and definition of recipe "))；来源于盎格鲁法语或古北法语 _receite_ (“收据，处方”) (约1300年)，受到 _receit_ “他接收” (he receives) 的影响（源自口语拉丁语 _\*recipit_）而变形，原是古法语 _recete_。该词出自中世纪拉丁语 _recepta_ “收到的事物或钱”，在古典拉丁语中为“接收的” (received)，是动词 _recipere_ “持有，包含” (to hold, contain) 的女性过去分词 (见 [receive](https://www.etymonline.com/word/receive "Etymology, meaning and definition of receive "))。

古典语中的 _\-p-_ 在1500年左右开始恢复于英语单词中，但发音并未随之变化。_Conceit_、_deceit_ 和 _receipt_ 均来自拉丁语 _capere_；有时它在三个词中都被恢复，但最终只保留在最后一个词中。表示“书面确认收到特定物品的证明” (written acknowledgment for having received something specified) 的意义出现在1600年左右。
